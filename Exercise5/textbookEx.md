__4.5 : Determine the result of the following expressions.__
(a) -30 * 3 + 21 / 5 = -86
(b) -30 + 3 * 21 / 5 = -18
(c) 30 / 3 * 21 % 5 = 0
(d) -30 / 3 * 21 % 4 = -2


__4.17 : Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment.__
    With prefix increment, the value of the variable is incremented first then used. With postfix increment, the value of the variable is used first then incremented.

__4.34 : Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take place in the following expressions:__
(a) if (fval) float to boolean (false)
(b) dval = fval + ival;  int and float to double
(c) dval + ival * cval;  double and char to int
